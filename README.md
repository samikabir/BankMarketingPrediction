# BankMarketingPrediction
Five Machine Learning Models - Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes have been applied on bank-full.csv dataset. 

This dataset contains information related to bank's clients and bank's previous marketing campaign. Objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit product offering by the bank or not.

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) has shown the highest prediction accuracy (88.11%) in this context. Python language has been used to call these Machine Learning models.
